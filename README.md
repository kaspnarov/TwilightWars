# TwilightWars
 A medieval fantasy-inspired version of the classic Stratego game. 

 This is a personal project to redesign a tabletop game that I enjoy. 

## How to play
To play the game all you have to do is: 
1. Download the executable file `twilightwars.exe` and the `src` folder.
2. Then, you can only double click the executable and play the game.
3. Enjoy :)

## How to inspect the code
If you wish to see the source code, you may just download the `source` folder that contains all the python files. 

Note that you'll also need the `src` folder if you wish to run the code this way.
